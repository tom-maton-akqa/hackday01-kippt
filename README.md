# HackDay #01
## Node, Kippt API & Heroku Mashup

### Introduction

We currently share many resources within the Web Development team, either through Email or other means.
There are potentially better ways to do this, such as making use of social bookmarking services like Kippt, Delicious or Pocket.
During the first AKQA Hack Day we'd like to attempt to create an internal link-sharing service leveraging the Kippt API. The idea is to contribute to the AKQA Web Development list internally, then build a service that can aggregate and mail the links out on a weekly basis with the eNewsletter grouping togeather content by hastags. e.g #javascript, #java, #css3 etc.

## The Task
Create a Node.js Application which sits on Heroku. The application spins up once a week, collects the latest content from our [AKQA Development List](https://kippt.com/AKQA/akqa-web-development) via the [Kippt API](http://developers.kippt.com/), sorts into groups, creates the eNewsletter and emails out over the SMTP server (Mandrill / Maill chimp plugin for Heroku)

#### Bonus Task
If we have capacity we could also publish a web page version or pull them in to the AKQA Dev Blog and auto tweet the link out.

### Installation
To get the required dependencies for the hack day project simply run:

```
npm install
```
For windows users you may need to do the following:
* Install python 2.7.5 – this is for the mailparser dependency, don’t install the latest. Its not compatible and will break the npm install.
* In your environment variables add to the Path variable, the path to your Python installation C:\Python27
* Then run npm install, if you’ve already run this, just uninstall it (npm uninstall mailparser) and install again.
